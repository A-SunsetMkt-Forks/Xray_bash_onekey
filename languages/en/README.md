## Instructions

* You can directly enter the command: `idleleo` to manage the script.
* It is recommended to use Nginx frontend for Reality, which can be installed in the script.
* It is recommended to enable fail2ban, which can be installed in the script.
* Using the sharing link [proposal](https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-core/issues/91) (beta) from [@DuckSoft](https://github.com/DuckSoft), supporting Qv2ray, V2rayN, V2rayNG.
* Using the proposal from [XTLS](https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-core/issues/158) project, following the [UUIDv5](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122#section-4.3) standard, custom strings can be mapped to VLESS UUID.
* Reality installation instructions: [Setting up Xray Reality Protocol Server](https://hey.run/archives/da-jian-xray-reality-xie-yi-fu-wu-qi).
* Risks of Reality protocol: [Risks of Xray Reality Protocol](https://hey.run/archives/reality-xie-yi-de-feng-xian).
* Accelerating server using Reality protocol: [Accelerating Server Using Reality Protocol "Vulnerability"](https://hey.run/archives/li-yong-reality-xie-yi-lou-dong-jia-su-fu-wu-qi).
* Added load balancing configuration, tutorial: [XRay Advanced Usage – Setting up Backend Server Load Balancing](https://hey.run/archives/xrayjin-jie-wan-fa---da-jian-hou-duan-fu-wu-qi-fu-zai-jun-heng).
* Added gRPC protocol support, details can be found at: [Xray Advanced Usage – Using gRPC Protocol](https://hey.run/archives/xrayjin-jie-wan-fa---shi-yong-grpcxie-yi).

## Certificate

If you already have the certificate files for your domain name, you can name the crt and key files as xray.crt and xray.key and place them in the /etc/idleleo/cert directory (create the directory if it doesn't exist), please note the certificate file permissions and validity period, custom certificates need to be renewed manually after expiration.

The script supports automatic generation of Let's Encrypted certificates, valid for 3 months, theoretically supporting automatic renewal.

## Xray Introduction

* Xray is an excellent open-source network proxy tool that can help you enjoy the internet smoothly, currently supporting Windows, Mac, Android, IOS, Linux and other operating systems.
* This script is a one-click complete configuration script. After all processes run normally, you can directly set up the client according to the output results.
* Please note: We still strongly recommend that you fully understand the entire program's workflow and principles.

## Recommend Setting Up Single Proxy on Single Server

* This script installs the latest version of Xray core by default.
* It is recommended to use the default port 443 as the connection port.
* The disguise content can be replaced as needed.

## Other Notes

* Recommended to use this script in a clean environment. If you are a beginner, please do not use Centos system.
* Please do not apply this program to production environment before confirming this script is actually usable.
* This program depends on Nginx to implement related functions. Users who have installed Nginx using [LNMP](https://lnmp.org) or other similar Nginx scripts should pay special attention, using this script may cause unpredictable errors.
* Centos system users please allow program-related ports (default: 80, 443) in the firewall in advance.
